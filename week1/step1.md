Step 1: Describe your sample. Provide enough detail so that your reader can clearly understand the population that the study sample came from. Use meaningful labels. Do not use abbreviations (“PPM100”) or variable names.

The sample is from a survey of 700 internet-mediated sex workers. The survey was carried out by Cunningham, Scott, and Todd D. Kendall between August, 2008 and June, 2009, known as the Survey of Adult Service Providers (SASP).

dataset is publicly available in R datasets collection and could be found here https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/doc/causaldata/adult_services.html

Its a dataframe with 1787 rows and 31 variables. however after removing NaN values there are only 1499 rows left. for some reason the number of sex workers in the dataset is 460 (number of the unique ids). its signficantly fewer than 700 (the number stated in the dataset overview).
