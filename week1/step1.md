Step 1: Describe your sample. Provide enough detail so that your reader can clearly understand the population that the study sample came from. Use meaningful labels. Do not use abbreviations (“PPM100”) or variable names.

a) Describe the study population (who or what was studied).



b) Report the level of analysis studied (individual, group, or aggregate).



c) Report the number of observations in the data set.



d) Describe your data analytic sample (the sample you are using for your analyses).
