Step 2: Describe the procedures that were used to collect the data.


The Survey of Adult Service Providers (SASP) focuses on the population of sex workers who solicit online. The original purpose of the data collection is to answer the question whether there are any differences between internet-mediated and traditional street-based sex workers.

the data were collected as follows:
"SASP was implemented by sending requests to all valid email addresses among TER-reviewed workers, supplemented with a sample of sex workers who advertise on a popular national site for escort ads, Eros.com.  In the email, respondents were asked to click on a link that led them to the survey, hosted on Baylor University servers.  Each email sent was associated with a randomly-generated string of characters, which allowed us to prevent multiple responses from the same email, while at the same time maintaining the anonymity of the survey, which we found to be a key factor driving participation"

the data were collected in the US between August, 2008 and June, 2009
